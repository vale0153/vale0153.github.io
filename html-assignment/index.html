    <p>Hi everyone! Or anyone who decides to read this. My name is Matteo, and I am currently a full time Algonquin College student in the Interactive Media Design program. 
    <br> I tried college for the first time last year, with the Computer Systems Tech program, but.. That didnâ€™t go well as I dropped out a month after I started. I then took a year off and reapplied this February. 
    </p> 



    <p>Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games and watching YouTube during my spare time. One of my favourite games as of recently is Doom Eternal, and I have been playing a lot of it. 
      <br>I also enjoy watching anime and playing guitar, which I have been doing for about 5 years now. Another extra-curricular activity I have is karate, in which I am a junior black belt and I have been doing it for over 6 years.
