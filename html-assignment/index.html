    <p>Hi everyone! Or anyone who decides to read this. My name is Matteo, and I am currently a full time Algonquin College student in the Interactive Media Design program. I tried college for the first time last year, with the Computer Systems Tech program, but.. That didnâ€™t go well as I dropped out a month after I started. I then took a year off and reapplied this February.
